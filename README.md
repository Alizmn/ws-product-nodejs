This is the most recommended way since it's one of the easiest to setup (requiring zero local effort), as well the easiest to share.

2. Set appropriate PostgreSQL environment variables according to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-envars.html
3. Run `$ npm run dev` and by default it should now be listening on port `5555`.
4. Open your browser and point to `localhost:5555` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

### Local Docker

0. Clone this repository
1. Store PostgreSQL environment variables into a `.env` file
2. Run `$ docker-compose up` (or `$ docker-compose up -d` to run in the background)
3. Open your browser and point to `localhost:5555` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

## Notes on working through the problems

Make sure any external dependencies are properly added into `package.json`. Unless otherwise specified, we welcome a healthy mix of your own implementations, and good choices of existing open-source libraries/tools.
